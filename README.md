Welcome and have a sit! üòÉ

I'll explain briefly what you can expect and what i've done:


This is an example, so the apis are obscured and the app wont work but you can check the code that i've done after them, but in the complete apk you can:

Land on the main screen, where you'll see all the conversations, you can click on the conversation or on their profile picture to see them in full screen. üñºÔ∏è

Once you entered the user's conversation, you'll find the messages, you can check the whole map in the chat, it is a real map, not a placeholder.

For the project I used:

MVVM, Hilt, Jetpack Compose, Navigation, Coroutines, Retrofit, Okhttp, Open Street Maps, gson, Coil and much more.

Enjoy and thank you for the time you'll dedicate to me and to my project, have a good day.
