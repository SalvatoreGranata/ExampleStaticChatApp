Welcome and have a sit! üòÉ

I'll explain briefly what you can expect and what i've done:

You'll land on the main screen, where you'll see all the conversations, you can click on the conversation or on their profile picture to see them in full screen. üñºÔ∏è

Once you entered the user's conversation, you'll find the messages, you can check the whole map in the chat, it is a real map, not a placeholder.

For the project I used:

MVVM, Hilt, Jetpack Compose, Navigation, Coroutines, Retrofit, Okhttp, Open Street Maps, gson, Coil and much more.

Enjoy and thank you for the time you'll dedicate to me and to my project, have a good day.
